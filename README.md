Interpolation Engine is a CLI tool to execute *programs* defined by JSON5 files.

**Why JSON5?** Valid *programs* are a subset of JSON5. JSON is unambiguous, easy to parse, fast to parse, and easy to write for experienced programmers. It is can express the nested structures that Interpolation Engine requires. I use JSON5 because I want comments, trailing commas, and optional quotes for keys.
